# Crime-Detection-
Crime Predictive Model/Tool for Hotspot Mapping: Predict crime occurrences and map crime hotspots
Objective: Predict total crimes in Indian districts and identify high-crime (hotspot) areas using the “Crime in India” dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/crime-in-india).
Dataset: We’ll use “01_District_wise_crimes_committed_IPC_2001_2012.csv” for simplicity, focusing on crimes like murder, robbery, burglary, theft, and rape.
Tools: Google Colab, pandas (data handling), scikit-learn (Linear Regression for prediction, K-Means for hotspots), seaborn/matplotlib (visualization).
